    <h1>This is So Funny</h1>
    <p>Why is it that people like to people watch. Is it that we 
        all think that we are funny looking or acting.  We all are
        more alike than we think but when you take a step back and look at
        how we act we tend to pick and choose who is normal or not normal
        like we are.</p>
